# Twine Minigame 3

## Devlog

My game requires the player to collect a key in order to win. I did this by adding a variable and setting it to 1 when the player found the key. Then, at the end of the game, I used an if macro to check if the player has the key, and an else to write the fail message.



The reason I used an if instead of making a new passage is because there is no decision to make. The player does not need to do anything, the game just needs to check if they have the key.
